Emily Caito is an emerging artist currently residing in Cincinnati, Ohio.  She combines complex geometric shapes with elegant poses to create a delicate sense of gesture.  This work shows an in depth investigation into the study of anatomy along with a critical understanding of the importance of expression throughout the figure.  The forms not only refer to the organic character of the figure, but also signify something that is completely industrial and mechanical.  
 
Emily received her BFA from the University of Cincinnati in 2006.  Since then, she has further refined her skills by working as a professional bronze artist at a foundry in Cincinnati. In addition to bronze, Emily’s art also encompasses drawing, printmaking, and digital media.  She is also a founding member of the Cincinnati based artist cooperative “Arthole.”
