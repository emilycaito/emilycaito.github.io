I am a new member to Tiger Lily Press here in Cincinnati and decided to take part in their woodblock calendar for the year 2011. This past weekend, and friend of mine and myself did a marathon print session and pulled over 200 prints between the two of us (204 to be exact) for the calendar project.Â  It was exhausting but a lot of fun at the same time!

Special thanks to Aaron Kent who was my partner in crime during this madness!
