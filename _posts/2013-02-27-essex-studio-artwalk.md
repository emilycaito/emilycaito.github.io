Join me this Friday March 1st for a screen printing demo during the Essex Studio Artwalk.  I am  the guest artist of DIY Print Shop in studio 188.  There will be lots of food, printing, and (of course) art!  If you can&#8217;t make it Friday, stop by on Saturday to check out local artist Vlad Plitsyn working on some prints.
