A while back, we got a call at the foundry from a cemetary in Indiana about recreating a bronze palm frond that was stolen from a monument and most likely sold for scrap.  We were hired to create a replica to replace the stolen element of the monument.  A template was made from the existing mounting points and the remaining eroded stone.  I resculpted a new frond from this template and a small photo that was provided by the family.  This past month, we wrapped up the project and installed the replica back in the cemetery.
